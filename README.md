# Hey there 👋 I'm Sowmya

A curious coder, a recent master's grad, and someone who still gets excited by a passing green test suite ✅.

## 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm currently making the jump from **Quality Assurance** into **Software Development**, bringing along my love for clean code, test automation, and a slightly unhealthy obsession with debugging edge cases.

My background is rooted in **testing real-world applications**, writing test cases, chasing down bugs, and collaborating in agile teams. Now, I’m channeling that same hands-on mindset into building full-stack apps — and it’s been a fun ride so far.

## 🧰 Tech Toolbox

Things I've used, broken, fixed, and enjoyed:

- **Languages:** JavaScript, Python, Java, HTML, CSS  
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MySQL  
- **Testing:** Selenium, Postman, JUnit, PyTest  
- **Tools:** Git & GitHub, VS Code, Docker (learning), Jira, Linux

I love learning by doing — and by breaking things just enough to fix them better.

## 🛠 Projects in Progress

- 🧪 **Bug Tracker App** — Where QA meets full-stack: a tool for logging, tracking, and resolving issues  
- 🧠 **Habit Tracker** — A minimal, responsive app built with React + Express  
- 🧰 **Automation Scripts Repo** — A growing collection of Selenium/Python-based test scripts  
- 💬 **Feedback Board** — Think “feature requests meets Trello,” built in MERN stack

_(You’ll find these and more in my pinned repos — with lots more to come!)_

## ✨ Random Facts

- I like reading patch notes and release changelogs (yes, really).  
- Clean commits make me happy.  
- I have a low tolerance for flaky tests and an irrational fear of merge conflicts.  
- I believe soft skills are underrated in tech.
